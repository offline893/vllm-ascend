### Overview
Experts rebalancing of MoE models for LLM serving is a mandatory option.Changing experts dynamically would have a negative impact on TTFT and TPOT while stop-the-world. 
Asynchronously expert load balacing would be a better choice.

1. Host-bound latency:
There are many cpu operations such as eplb-algorithm、creating p2p ops、 and other python operating will spend long cpu time, as ~1s.
2. Communication latency:
The transfer time would cost much in the situation without nvlink. As the weight of an expert maybe transfer to multiple new positions, thus N times send/recv for one expert, with result long latency, as ~20ms for each layer.
